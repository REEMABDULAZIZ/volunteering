        Do something exciting and different this year and take part in a volunteer opportunity abroad. You’ll have a direct role in supporting local communities or protecting endangered environments. 

You’ll grow in confidence and discover more of what you’re capable of as you work and meet people from all corners of the world. Our international volunteer programs are all built around implementing long-term, sustainable solutions to problems we’ve identified. You’ll use your time, energy, and skills to help us work toward those goals. 

International volunteering is the perfect opportunity to also gain new skills and learn from the people you meet. You’ll work alongside experienced professionals. This will help you build your knowledge and hone skills like communication and organization. You’ll also be able to learn from our passionate and dedicated in-country staff. They’ll be there 24/7 to give you support when you need it.
